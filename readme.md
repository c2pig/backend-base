## Design concern
### Initialization
- [ ] How easy a developer can use baseline code?

### Reusability
Question?
- [ ] How do we make developer code as a sharable module to use by other project?

- [ ] How does the developer use baseline as a base code and add extra module on top of it to establish review pipeline?

### Extension
- [ ] How do we allow developer extend or override module functionality(eg: validation)
